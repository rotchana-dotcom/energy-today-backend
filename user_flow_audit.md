# Energy Today - User Flow Audit

## Goal
Make the app more user-friendly by improving connections between features to showcase versatility without major changes.

## Current User Journey Issues

### 1. **Today Screen → Insights Flow**
**Current:** 
- User sees energy score (e.g., 74%)
- "Track Your Success" widget shows but button goes to Analytics Dashboard
- No clear path to see WHY their energy is 74%

**Should Be:**
- Energy score → tap to see breakdown
- "What's affecting your energy today?" → link to personal factors
- Success widget → should show today's logged outcome, not just generic message

### 2. **Calendar → Task Scheduling Flow**
**Current:**
- Calendar shows energy levels by day
- No way to add tasks directly from calendar
- No "Schedule this task at optimal time" button

**Should Be:**
- Calendar → "Add Task" button
- Task creation → "Find optimal time" suggestion
- Link to Task Scheduler for AI recommendations

### 3. **Business Tab → Results Tracking Flow**
**Current:**
- Business tab shows stats
- "Results Tracking" card exists but unclear what it does
- No clear connection to Analytics Dashboard

**Should Be:**
- Business stats → "See detailed analysis" → Analytics Dashboard
- "Log today's outcome" prominent button
- Clear path: Log outcome → See patterns → Schedule better

### 4. **AI Insights → Action Flow**
**Current:**
- AI Insights shows personality, energy factors, success patterns
- No actionable next steps
- User reads insights but doesn't know what to do

**Should Be:**
- After showing insights → "Apply these insights" buttons
- "Schedule based on these patterns" → Task Scheduler
- "Track to improve accuracy" → Results Tracking

### 5. **More Tab → Feature Discovery**
**Current:**
- Long list of features
- No categorization or guidance
- Users don't know what to tap first

**Should Be:**
- Grouped by purpose (Track, Analyze, Optimize, Wellness)
- "Recommended for you" section
- "Start here" guidance for new users

## Key Missing Connections

### Missing Link 1: Energy Score → Explanation
- User sees "74%" but can't tap to understand why
- Should link to: Personal Energy Factors screen

### Missing Link 2: Success Patterns → Scheduling
- User sees "You're 85% successful at 10am"
- No button to "Schedule my tasks at 10am"
- Should link to: Task Scheduler with pre-filled optimal times

### Missing Link 3: Tracking → Insights → Action
- User tracks sleep, nutrition, activities
- No clear "See how this affects your energy" link
- Should link to: Correlation Engine / Personal Factors

### Missing Link 4: Outcome Logging → Pattern Analysis
- User logs "Great day" or "Bad day"
- No immediate feedback on patterns
- Should show: "Based on 10 outcomes, here's your pattern"

### Missing Link 5: Team Features → Business Value
- Team Sync, Team Members exist but feel disconnected
- No clear "Why use this?" explanation
- Should show: "Schedule team meetings when everyone's energy is high"

## Quick Wins (No Major Changes)

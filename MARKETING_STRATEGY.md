## Positioning

### Core Message
**"Schedule your success. Know when you'll perform best."**

### Value Proposition
Energy Today is **not another calendar app** - it's a **timing optimizer** that tells you:
- ✅ **WHEN** to schedule important meetings (not just where)
- ✅ **WHY** today is good or bad for decisions
- ✅ **PROOF** that it works (track outcomes, see patterns)

### Differentiation

**vs. Todoist/TickTick:**
- They say: "Meeting at 2pm Tuesday"
- We say: "Meeting at 10am Tuesday (your peak energy, 87% success rate)"

**vs. Google Calendar:**
- They show: When you're free
- We show: When you'll perform best

**vs. Habit Trackers:**
- They track: What you did
- We predict: When you'll succeed
